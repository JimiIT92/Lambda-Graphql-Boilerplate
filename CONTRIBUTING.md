You are free to contribute in any way you like it, however be sure to not introduce any platform specific/dependant code to the project 
(since this is a boilerplate that is supposed to run on most machines). Also try to keep things simple and readable. Again, this is
just a template, therefore there shouldn't be functions there are too specialized for a job (and in general these must be template functions)
