Boilerplate code to make a fast GraphQL Apollo Server
running on AWS Lambda. Just add in your models/resolvers
and you are good to go! 😁

## 🔧 Install

Clone this repository on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/GimignanoF/Lambda-Graphql-Boilerplate
```

Open the project in your favorite IDE or text editor
(I suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Once open, open a new terminal and install the project dependencies

```
npm install
```

Remember to rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
or make your own `.env` file!

## 🔗 Dependencies

Since the project is intended to run on AWS Lambda, you need
[Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) installed
to make it run on your local machine too.
Otherwise you need to change the `src/app.js` code
to start a web server with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).
Note that in this case you won't be able to deploy the service
to AWS Lambda, since Lambda can't run a normal Apollo Server.
